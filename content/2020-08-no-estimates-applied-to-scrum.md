# #NoEstimates applied to Scrum

I was able to gain experiences about estimations in software projects, its benefits and pitfalls. 
When starting a new project recently, I had the chance to apply everything I know in a new way by using no estimates at all.

## Why no estimates?
It was not our intention to avoid estimations by all means, but to find the best working process for our team. 
We started with only what we needed, mostly picking the basic events from the Scrum framework. 
We just never introduced estimations. They would have been inaccurate in the beginning anyways and we felt no need to introduce them later on.

## How did we plan our sprints?
We knew what would be important for the next couple of weeks for our stakeholders. 
So we discussed how we can achieve that in the most simple way possible while still keeping an eye on the software quality.
That's basically it. We knew each others needs and have been transparent what we as team strive to deliver in the next sprint.

## What were the results of this approach?
As a result we basically always completed more as expected. We also noticed that:
 - There was no fear of not meeting the estimations. But an urge to deliver value to our customers with everything we do.
 - As we safed time searching for the correct estimation, we focused more on the stories and their impact itself. Cutting down the details to the ones that are really needed.
 - We strived to create the right things in the right way as fast as possible. Instead of trying to hit the estimation as measure of success.
 - No one asked for our estimations.
 - We could quickly build up trust by deliviering valuable things every sprint.
